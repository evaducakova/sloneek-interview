# ðŸ’¸ Expenses Tracker Web App

## Objective
Develop a simple expenses tracker application that allows users to effectively manage and control their budgets.

## Core Functionalities
1. **Category Management:**
    - Allow users to define and manage expense categories (e.g., food, travel, entertainment).

2. **Expense and Income Recording:**
    - Enable users to record their expenses and incomes with details including date, description, and value.
    - Expenses and incomes should be visually distinguishable by color.

3. **Data Visualization:**
    - Provide charts for visualizing data, including pie charts and bar graphs.
    - Show average values for expenses and incomes.

## Additional Functionalities
To further showcase your skills and enhance the application's functionality, it is recommended to complete some or all of the additional assignments listed below. These additional features will demonstrate your proficiency in Angular development and your ability to implement advanced functionalities.

1. **User Authentication:**
    - Implement a simple user login system to manage individual user sessions based on JWT tokens.

2. **Data Filtering:**
    - Implement advanced filtering options to allow users to view their data based on date ranges, categories, and specific keywords.
    - Include quick filters for common timeframes (e.g., last week, last month, last year).

3. **Form Validations:**
    - Ensure all forms have robust validation for data entry to prevent incorrect or incomplete information from being recorded.
    - Provide user-friendly error messages and validation feedback.

4. **State Management:**
    - Implement state management using Angular tools, NgRx or a similar library to efficiently handle application state and improve performance.
    - Use state management to ensure consistent data across different components and views.

5. **Expense and Income Summary:**
    - Display a summary section showing total expenses, total income, and net balance.
    - Provide insights such as highest spending category and average daily spending.

6. **Search Functionality:**
    - Implement a search bar allowing users to quickly find specific transactions by keywords or amounts.

7. **Application Testing:**
    - Write unit tests for individual components and services using Jasmine and Karma.
    

## Development Requirements
- The application must be developed using Angular.
- Use UI libraries of your choice to enhance the user interface and user experience.
- If you choose to implement user authentication, we prefer that you use existing backend APIs. Otherwise, data can be stored locally (e.g. using Local Storage or IndexedDB).
- Ensure that the application is well documented, with clear instructions on how to run and test the application.
- Prioritize the quality of code for core functionalities over the quantity of features implemented.
- If you don't implement some features, be able to explain how you would implement them.
- Please be prepared to present your application during the interview.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository, create your own private repository and invite filip.kudla@sloneek.com and lubomir.balogh@sloneek.com
2. Generate new Angular application
3. Run the backend (navigate to the backend folder and follow the instructions in its README.md to start it)
4. Start your development
